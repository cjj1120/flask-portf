                    <p>Dived deep into machine learning, been reading a lot and learning intensively. The Scikit-learn module emphasized heavily 
                        on practical coding and has effectively helped in implementing the codes and understand tough concepts like hyperparameter tuning.
                       boosting vs bagging and ensemble learning.   
                       <br> <br>
                       This course has helped me to understand many high level machine learning concepts and get my hands dirty on every notebook exercises I have done.
                       The course was designed by the core developers of the Scikit-learn library which has really helped to get a solid head start to my Machine learning journry.

                    <p>For Azure AI 900: <br> Learned about Azure cloud and how to implement Artificial intelligence on cloud. I’ve benefited from the top-down approach design of the course. Learned about actual implementation of machine learning, computer vision workloads, Natural Language Processing (NLP) workloads and features of conversational AI workloads on Azure.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>For Azure DP 900: <br> Unlike AI 900 which I have prior knowledge, DP 900 was much tougher as I have to learn many databases concepts and data workloads.
                        Core topics that I have learned are how to work with relational data on Azure; how to work with non-relational data on Azure; and an analytics workload on Azure which includes Power BI    </p> 
                    <p>After months of learning Machine Learning with python, I was surprised how the work can be easily done on cloud platform, actual deployment can be made simple and faster with cloud platform like Azure. Below are the certificates that I have acquired and links to verify them:</p>

            <p>I developed interest in programming when I was taking statistics course back in uni, I took beginner course for Data science and started my programming journey. After my graduation, I started to learn web development and I’ve built static websites with templates available online. When I was working I was exposed to mobile app development and got the chance to maintain and upgrade a wordpress website. </p>

            <p class="mb-0">As I dived deeper into programming I developed interest in the more advanced topics like Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence and Deep learning. I’m currently taking Maths course to better understand the algorithm. I am also actively involved in open source projects and Kaggle competitions to sharpen my skill.</p>
