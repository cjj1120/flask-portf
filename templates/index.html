                <strong>I</strong> am fascinated by the fast-changing technology and the way it is transforming our life. 
                There are a few turning points in life that led to a change in my career path. I was intrigued by the predictive power of machine learning during my uni times, 
                when I was exposed to a lot of statistics in the psychology literature. I started working and I was assigned to manage comapany's website and 
                social media platforms. At some point, I made the decision to fully focus on learning Data science, machine learning and programming. 
                I identify myself as a self-taught programmer and am currently seeking opportunities in Data Science, Machine Learning relevant jobs.

                    <P>
                        This is a hobby project completed by a group of Web3 and Defi enthusiasts, my friend from Singapore and me. 
                        It took about a month and we are happy with the learning journey as well as the outcome! <br><br>

                        This project aims to provide an overview of the activities and cashflow in the decentralized finance sector. We have 
                        built a complete ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline and deployed to cloud. The data ingestion script (Extract) and data transformation script 
                        (Transform) were containerized with Docker and deployed to Google Cloud Run. The transformed data is then loaded (Load) to Google Big query data warehouse. 
                        The final dashboard is built with Metabase and deployed on Heroku.<br><br>

                        The pipeline has been revised several times to improve performance and save cost, at the beginning we used Google Postgres SQL and later 
                        switched to Big Query which saves much more cost. <br><br>
                        
                        Analytics was done in SQL on the Metabase platform, the dashboard has a custom ranking feature that provides a better approach to observe the protocols performance.
                        The final dashboard is a bit laggy since we are running on free tier on Heroku, and we didn't set a high computation configuration on GCP to save cost. 
                        <br><br>

                        It was a long and fruitful journey, and I'm glad to work on project that I'm interested in (Defi & Web3)!

                    This NLP project allowed me to learn most of the fundamental steps in NLP, and some of the core topics in NLP. I’ve learned about text data lemmatization, TF-IDF, Bag of Words, LDA topic modelling etc… It was a great experience working with people around the world and collaborating together. It was also a challenging yet fruitful learning process! Below are the outcomes of the project:

                        I have learned ML Ops, such as managing dependencies, dockerizing the model and deploying the model to cloud platforms.
                        I have also learned to deploy with AWS Lambda serverless function, which is a more cost-efficient method especially for lesser traffic purposes.
                        I enjoyed the course and the interactive and helpful community! Together with peers that share similar interest,
                        we often have interesting dicsussion in the slack channel that had helped me to understand various topics

                    <p>This challenge consists of three main stages. First stage is timed skill assessments, at this stage, I was tested on Data Science fundamental tools and concepts. For instance programming, statistics and data analysis in SQL. The second stage is the coding challenge, in which I need to apply data science skills (data cleaning, data manipulation, data visualization etc..) to complete a project that aims to solve real-world problem. 
                    <br> <br>
                    I’ve learned the most at the last stage- case study. I had to prepare a solution for a real-world issue and present to non-tech audiences within 24 hours. Throughout my learning, I've been exposed to and used many technical terms, and to translate them to non-tech audiences requires an in-depth level of understanding of the topics. This deepened my understanding of some of the ML topics, and reminded me to be more problem-centric for my future projects. Ultimately, the goal of a ML model is to solve real-world issues.

                       <br> <br>
                       This course has helped me to understand many high level machine learning concepts and get my hands dirty on every notebook exercises I have done.
                       The course was designed by the core developers of Scikit-learn library which has really helped to get a solid head start on my Machine learning journry.

                    <p>For Azure AI 900: <br> Learned about Azure cloud and how to implement Artificial intelligence on cloud. I’ve benefited from the top-down approach design of the course. Learned about actual implementation of machine learning, computer vision workloads, Natural Language Processing (NLP) workloads and features of conversational AI workloads on Azure.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>For Azure DP 900: <br> Unlike AI 900 which I have prior knowledge, DP 900 was much tougher as I have to learn many databases concepts and data workloads.
                        Core topics that I have learned are how to work with relational data on Azure; how to work with non-relational data on Azure; and an analytics workload on Azure which includes Power BI    </p> 
                    <p>After months of learning Machine Learning with python, I was surprised how the work can be easily done on cloud platform, actual deployment can be made simple and faster with cloud platform like Azure. Below are the certificates that I have acquired and links to verify them:</p>

                        in carrying out a project.

            <p>I developed interest in programming when I was taking statistics course back in uni, I took beginner course for Data science and started my programming journey. After my graduation, I started to learn web development and I’ve built static websites with templates available online. When I started working I was exposed to mobile app development and got the chance to maintain and upgrade a wordpress website. </p>

            <p class="mb-0">As I dived deeper into programming I developed interest in the more advanced topics like Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence and Deep learning. I’m currently taking Maths course to better understand the algorithm. I am also actively involved in open source projects and Kaggle competitions to sharpen my skill.</p>
